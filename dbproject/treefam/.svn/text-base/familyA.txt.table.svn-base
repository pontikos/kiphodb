They interact with more than 200 different, mostly phosphorylated proteins. The molecular consequences of 14-3-3 binding are diverse: this binding may result in stabilization of the active or inactive phosphorylated form of the protein, to a conformational alteration leading to activation or inhibition, to a different subcellular localization, to the interaction with other proteins or to shielding of binding sites [PMID:16498703]. 14-3-3 controls cell cycle, cell growth, differentiation, survival, apoptosis, migration and spreading [PMID:1585757].	[alc] Merged TF102002 (YWHAB/G/H/Q/Z) with TF102003 (YWHAE) as they share outgroups. When they are merged, there are two poorly supported clades in the tree, each of which contains animal and plant/fungal outgroup sequences. Thus, it is hard to say whether this family should be split into two TreeFam families or not.

Follistatin binds and inhibits activin, and thereby negatively regulates processes as diverse as cell growth and (in humans) secretion of the reproductive hormone FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) [PMID:15734148]. Furthermore, in vertebrates follistatin is secreted from the dorsal mesoderm, and triggers neural differentiation in the ectoderm by binding BMP and therefore blocking BMP signalling [PMID:10087929].	The relationship between the FST and FSTL subgroups that we found agrees with that reported previously by Glusman et al 2004 [PMID:15527507], that is: (((FSTL5,FSTL4),FSTL1),FST). FST and the FSTL genes belong to a larger superfamily of proteins that contain one or more kazal-type serine protease inhibitor domains (also called follistatin domains). The kazal-type serine protease inhibitor domain is a conserved module of cysteine-rich sequence. For example, FST has 3 follistatin domains while FSTL1 has just one follistatin domain. Members of the follistatin superfamily include FST, FSTL1, SPARC, Agrin, Testican, Hevin, mac25, Ovomucoid, Complement C6 and Complement C7 genes [PMID:9799587]. However, these superfamily members are difficult to align, so in this tree we have included just the FST and FSTL genes, and we have currently left the SPARC, Agrin, Testican, Hevin, mac25, Ovomucoid, Complement C6 and Complement C7 genes in separate TreeFam families. Note that Pfam lists some plant genes with kazal-type serine protease inhibitor domains, which are likely to be outgroups to the FST, FSTL and other kazal-type serine protease inhibitor superfamily genes. These separate TreeFam families should perhaps be merged in the future.

TF105114	MAP3K4	mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 4		7	46		0000-00-00	2005-04-21	curated	The central core of each mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is a conserved cascade of 3 protein kinases: an activated MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK) phosphorylates and activates a specific MAPK kinase (MAPKK), which then activates a specific MAPK. While the ERK MAPKs are activated by mitogenic stimulation, the CSBP2 and JNK MAPKs are activated by environmental stresses such as osmotic shock, UV irradiation, wound stress, and inflammatory factors. This gene encodes a MAPKKK, the MEKK4 protein, also called MTK1. This protein contains a protein kinase catalytic domain at the C terminus. The N-terminal nonkinase domain may contain a regulatory domain. Expression of MEKK4 in mammalian cells activated the CSBP2 and JNK MAPK pathways, but not the ERK pathway. In vitro kinase studies indicated that recombinant MEKK4 can specifically phosphorylate and activate PRKMK6 and SERK1, MAPKKs that activate CSBP2 and JNK, respectively but cannot phosphorylate PRKMK1, an MAPKK that activates ERKs. MEKK4 is a major mediator of environmental stresses that activate the CSBP2 MAPK pathway, and a minor mediator of the JNK pathway. Two alternatively spliced transcripts encoding distinct isoforms have been described.

T-box genes have only been found in the metazoa, and the expansion of the T-box family from a single progenitor sequence probably occurred at the beginning of metazoan evolution [PMID:8878690]. T-box proteins bind a common element, the T-site, but promoter specificity is provided by interactions with other transcription factors. T-box genes function in many different signalling pathways, but common themes put T-box genes downstream of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling and upstream of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling [PMID:16285859]. The best studied T-box genes are those of the Brachyury subfamily, which have conserved expression around body orifices in bilaterians and cnidarians, that is around embryonic blastopore and gut openings. Thus, Brachyury may have a conserved role in formation of the blastopore and the extremities of the digestive tract [PMID:16547957]. In vertebrates, Brachyury is involved in cellular movements during gastrulation, as well as in cell differentiation in the notochord and other mesodermal tissues [PMID:9504043].	The T, TBX1, TBX2, TBX6 and TBR1 subfamilies from the phylogenetic tree in Figure 1 of Naiche et al 2006 [PMID:16285859] were recovered in our tree. Thus, I have used these names to name the subfamilies in the TreeFam tree. It is not clear where the Drosophila Doc1, Doc2 and Doc3 genes fit in the tree, although Minguillon & Logan 2003 suggest that they are related to the TBX6 subfamily [PMID:15239925].

Substrate specificity is the primary characteristic used to define members of this gene family. The ACADSB gene product has the greatest activity towards the short branched chain acyl-CoA derivative, (S)-2-methylbutyryl-CoA, but also reacts significantly with other 2-methyl branched chain substrates and with short straight chain acyl-CoAs. The cDNA encodes for a mitochondrial precursor protein which is cleaved upon mitochondrial import and predicted to yield a mature peptide of approximately 43.7-KDa.	This family might be a subfamily.

For example, in the developing neural tube of vertebrate embryos, many types of neuronal and nonneuronal cells differentiate in response to the secreted signalling molecule, SHH [PMID:11130176]. Recent evidence suggests hedgehog continues to function in adult tissue, by regulating both cell proliferation and the production of growth and angiogenic factors. In the adult nervous system, this dual ability is especially important in regulating the behavior of neural stem and progenitor cells [PMID:16776596].	[alc] Kumar et al 1996 [PMID:8849902] reported that the vertebrate Hh clades have topology ((SHH,IHH),DHH), which we also found. It is not clear to me whether there are fish members of the DHH vertebrate clade.

The SMO family is distantly related to the Type II, G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily of proteins [PMID:12196118]. Graul and Sadee 2001 [PMID:11741263] found that SMO is closely related to the Frizzled family, and that both of these are related to receptors for vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and cAMP and latrophilin receptors, and more distantly related to other GPCRs.	[alc] Note that this family does not contain any nematode genes, but it has the same domain structure (an Fz domain followed by a Frizzled domain) as members of the Frizzled TreeFam family [PMID:11741263], which does contain nematode genes. At present I have not merged these families as they are large. This family does not contain any outgroup (yeast/plant) genes, but yeast and plant GPCRs are known, so could perhaps be used as outgroups for this family.

In addition to their established functions for cell survival, NTs also mediate higher brain activities such as learning and memory [PMID:16825799]. It appears that not only Caenorhabditis elegans but also Drosophila melanogaster lack homologs of the neurotrophins or their trk receptors [PMID:11164937].	Neurotrophins have a nerve growth factor (NGF) Pfam domain, and so belong to the cystine-knot superfamily of proteins with a cystine-knot structural motif. This superfamily is animal-specific, and comprises of many proteins such as BMP antagonists, TGF-beta, growth differentiation factors (GDFs), gonadotropins, platelet-derived growth factors, and BMPs [PMID:11328851]. The neurotrophins are distantly related to the other cystine-knot superfamily genes [PMID:11328851].

Trk receptors are a family of three receptor tyrosine kinases, each of which can be activated by one or more of four neurotrophins (NTs). Neurotrophins bind to Trk receptor tyrosine kinases to activate several different signaling pathways that mediate various biological functions. Neurotrophin signaling through these receptors regulates cell survival, proliferation, the fate of neural precursors, axon and dendrite growth and patterning, and the expression and activity of functionally important proteins, such as ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors. In the adult nervous system, the Trk receptors regulate synaptic strength and plasticity. Trk receptor activation has been well-studied and triggers the well-characterized Ras/Rap-MAPK, PI3K-Akt, and PLCgamma-PKC cascades [PMID:12676795][PMID:16699811].	[alc] The TRK TreeFam family belongs to the Tyr protein kinase protein superfamily, which has members in plants and fungi.

The mammalian testis-specific thioredoxin system comprises three thioredoxins exclusively expressed in spermatids, (including TXNDC3, which is in this family; also called SPTRX2), and an additional thioredoxin highly expressed in testis called TXNDC6 (also called TXL2) [PMID:14713334]. The TXNDC3 and TXNDC6 proteins in this family have an N-terminal thioredoxin domain and a C-terminal NDP kinase domain. In contrast, there are also NME7 proteins in this family, which have an NDP kinase domain, but no thioredoxin domain. Nucleoside diphosphate kinases are enzymes required for the synthesis of nucleoside triphosphates other than ATP [PMID:11768308].	[lh3] TXNDC3 is also called NME8. [alc] Merged the TreeFam families TF106374 and TF106372, as TF106372 didn"t have a plant/fungal outgroup. The genes in the two families all have a nucleoside diphosphate kinase domain, although many genes in family TF106374 had a nucleoside diphosphate kinase domain and a Dpy-30 domain, while many genes in the TF106372 family had a thioredoxin Pfam domain and a nucleoside diphosphate kinase Pfam domain. When the two families are merged, the new tree is based on the nucleoside diphosphate kinase domain, and the outgroup sequences form a clade with 100% bootstrap support.

TF106479	RELN	Reelin	Reelin precursor	7	33		0000-00-00	2006-08-24	raw	The extracellular protein Reelin is crucial for neuronal positioning during brain development in vertebrates, in particular for regulating how the layers of the cortex are laid down [PMID:15655250]. Several neuronal populations throughout the brain secrete Reelin, which binds to the lipoprotein receptors Vldlr and Apoer2 on the surface of target cells which include migrating neurons. This induces phosphorylation of Dab1 and triggers an intracellular cascade which instructs neurons to assume their proper shape and location [PMID:16198608]. Reelin has an additional function in the mature vertebrate brain, which is to modulate synaptic plasticity and to favour memory formation [PMID:16102539]. This second activity is carried out via Apoer2. Costagli et al 2002 report that no Reelin-related sequences have been identified in invertebrate genomes, and suggested that Reelin may be a chordate-specific molecule involved in regulating the migratory behaviour of neuronal groups and the synaptic organisation of brains [PMID:12124768].	The macaque predictions ENSMMUT00000008358 and ENSMMUT00000008359 seem to be two parts of the macaque Reelin gene, which seems to have been incorrectly split into two predictions. Likewise, the two cow predictions ENSBTAG00000003657 and ENSBTAG00000003658 seem to result from incorrect splitting of a gene. The RELN family is related to the F-spondin (SPON1) and mindin (SPON2) genes, with which it shares a Pfam Reeler domain. F-spondin and mindin have been put together in a different TreeFam family, because they align poorly to the Reelin genes.

On the other hand, the related LBR family contains a Drosophila gene but no Caenorhabditis gene. It is not entirely clear whether these two families should be merged into one family. The Arabidopsis gene At1g50430 was manually added to this family because has been shown experimentally to have 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase activity [PMID: 10758495], however this gene has a stronger hmmer match to the LBR TreeFam family (score 727) than to this family (score 399).

TF105081	ABL	v-abl Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene		18	74		0000-00-00	2005-04-15	curated	The ABL1 protooncogene encodes a cytoplasmic and nuclear protein tyrosine kinase that has been implicated in processes of cell differentiation, cell division, cell adhesion, and stress response. Activity of c-Abl protein is negatively regulated by its SH3 domain, and deletion of the SH3 domain turns ABL1 into an oncogene. The t(9;22) translocation results in the head-to-tail fusion of the BCR (MIM:151410) and ABL1 genes present in many cases of chronic myelogeneous leukemia. The DNA-binding activity of the ubiquitously expressed ABL1 tyrosine kinase is regulated by CDC2-mediated phosphorylation, suggesting a cell cycle function for ABL1. The ABL1 gene is expressed as either a 6- or 7-kb mRNA transcript, with alternatively spliced first exons spliced to the common exons 2-11. ABL2 is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase which is closely related to but distinct from ABL1. The similarity of the proteins includes the tyrosine kinase domains and extends amino-terminal to include the SH2 and SH3 domains. ABL2 is expressed in both normal and tumor cells. The ABL2 gene product is expressed as two variants bearing different amino termini, both approximately 12-kb in length.	Other sequences in full should not belong to this family.

TF105082	BCR/ABR	breakpoint cluster region / active BCR-related gene		16	76		0000-00-00	2005-04-15	curated	A reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 22 and 9 produces the Philadelphia chromosome, which is often found in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. The chromosome 22 breakpoint for this translocation is located within the BCR gene. The translocation produces a fusion protein which is encoded by sequence from both BCR and ABL, the gene at the chromosome 9 breakpoint. Although the BCR-ABL fusion protein has been extensively studied, the function of the normal BCR gene product is not clear. The protein has serine/threonine kinase activity and is a GTPase-activating protein for p21rac. ABR encodes a protein that is similar to the protein encoded by the breakpoint cluster region gene located on chromosome 22. The protein encoded by this gene contains a GTPase-activating protein domain, a domain found in members of the Rho family of GTP-binding proteins. Functional studies in mice determined that this protein plays a role in vestibular morphogenesis, suggesting that Rho-related GTPases help coordinate motor skills and balance. Alternatively spliced transcript variants that encode different isoforms have been reported for this gene.

Thought to repress homeotic gene expression during embryonic development in Drosophila. [PMID: 10445843] Mammalian homologs repress Hox gene expression. [PMID: 9570953]	There is very little published research relating to SCML4, so it is difficult to determine the correct topology for this subfamily. SCMH1 and SCML2 appear to be more closely related. However, it is difficult to determine where the insect and fish genes should be placed within the tree. SCHMA/ANOGA/DROME/CIOIN genes appear to align better with SCMH1/SCML2. DROME genes ph-d-RA and ph-p-RA do not align well and may belong with a family of PHC genes (TF331703), so have been removed from the tree. Some of the fish genes appear to be truncated and may be mispredicted. Curation of this tree has not been completed, as the tree needs to be built based on local alignments and new scripts are needed in order to do this. Looking at the Jalview alignment, it appears that SCML4 has undergone domain shuffling, as it contains a different N terminal domain but has the same C terminal domains as SCMH1 and SCML2. As a result, it is difficult to decide whether SCML4 is part of the same family as SCMH1 and SCML2, or whether it would be better for SCML4 to be made into a separate family.

TF105097	MAPK1/3	mitogen-activated protein kinase 1/3		67	125		0000-00-00	2006-02-20	raw	The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the MAP kinase family. MAP kinases, also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), act as an integration point for multiple biochemical signals, and are involved in a wide variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, transcription regulation and development. The activation of this kinase requires its phosphorylation by upstream kinases. Upon activation, this kinase translocates to the nucleus of the stimulated cells, where it phosphorylates nuclear targets. Two alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein, but differing in the UTRs, have been reported for this gene.	mpk-2_CAEEL probably belongs to another family where no vertebrate genes are present. I leave it there anyway.

The encoded protein is a member of the serine/threonine protein kinase family. This kinase can activate both the MAP kinase and JNK kinase pathways. This kinase was shown to activate IkappaB kinases, and thus induce the nuclear production of NF-kappaB. This kinase was also found to promote the production of TNF-alpha and IL-2 during T lymphocyte activation. Studies of a similar gene in rat suggested the direct involvement of this kinase in the proteolysis of NF-kappaB1,p105 (NFKB1). This gene may also utilize a downstream in-frame translation start codon, and thus produce an isoform containing a shorter N-terminus. The shorter isoform has been shown to display weaker transforming activity.

The plant and fungal outgroup sequences have been manually grouped together in the curated tree. However, the plant/fungal sequences are very divergent, and there is very little phylogenetic support for any particular placement of the plant/fungal sequences with respect to the animal genes in the tree. It is also virtually impossible at the moment to see which chordate, arthropod and vertebrate genes group together, so this tree should not be relied on for inferring arthropod-chordate-nematode orthologues. However, the RDH11, RDH12, RDH13 and RDH14 vertebrate clades are obvious in the tree. Haeseleer et al [PMID:12226107] made a phylogenetic tree with the topology ((RDH13,RDH14),RDH11,RDH12), while Keller et al [PMID:16406282] found (((RDH11,RDH12),RDH13),RDH14).

TF105048	HYOU1	hypoxia up-regulated 1		17	53		0000-00-00	2005-04-11	curated	The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the heat shock protein 70 family. This gene has three mRNAs from the use of alternative transcription sites. A cis-acting segment is found at the 5" end of exon 1A which is involved in the stress-dependent induction. The transcript that begins with exon 1B is preferentially induced by hypoxia, resulting in the accumulation of this protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The protein encoded by this gene is thought to play an important role in protein folding and secretion in the ER. Since suppression of the protein is associated with accelerated apoptosis, it is also suggested to have an important cytoprotective role in hypoxia-induced cellular perturbation. This protein has been shown to be up-regulated in tumors, especially in breast tumors, and thus it is associated with tumor invasiveness. There is also an alternative translation site of this gene which lacks the signal peptide. This signal peptide-lacking protein, is only 3 amino acids shorter than the mature protein in the ER, and it is thought to have a housekeeping function in the cytosol.

The protein encoded by this gene is an enzyme that hydrolyzes oxidized purine nucleoside triphosphates, such as 8-oxo-dGTP, 8-oxo-dATP, 2-hydroxy-dATP, and 2-hydroxy rATP, to monophosphates, thereby preventing misincorporation. The encoded protein is localized mainly in the cytoplasm, with some in the mitochondria, suggesting that it is involved in the sanitization of nucleotide pools both for nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants, some of which encode distinct isoforms, have been identified. Additional variants have been observed, but their full-length natures have not been determined.

JMJD2A associates with retinoblastoma protein and class I histone deacetylases, repressing transcription of E2F-responsive promoters [PMID: 15927959]. JMJD2 genes function in the control of cell proliferation, thus mutations in these genes can lead to cancer development [PMID: 15138608].	It is difficult to determine the correct topology of the tree due to a lack of published research. JMJD2D does not contain any introns, so may be a pseudogene. The gene does appear to encode a protein, although this is truncated. According to tctool, the best topology is for the JMJD2D genes to be grouped with the JMJD2B genes.

Such antagonism inhibits BMP signaling by blocking its binding to the receptor. Modulation of BMP signaling is phylogenetically conserved and is a key step for the establishment of the dorso-ventral axis in vertebrates and invertebrates. Most other members of the CHRD family also act as BMP antagonists [PMID:11992721].	Note that the CHRD, CHRDL1, CHRDL2, CRIM1, CRIM2 and NOGG subfamilies are quite well supported in the tree for this family, but the relationships between these subfamilies are not clear. However, we have put these subfamilies together in this TreeFam family because the CHRD and NOG genes were grouped together by Avsian-Kretchmer and Hsueh [PMID:14525956]. The CHRD and NOG genes belong to a larger superfamily of proteins that contain one or more kazal-type serine protease inhibitor domains. The kazal-type serine protease inhibitor domain is a conserved module of cysteine-rich sequence. Members of the kazal-type serine protease inhibitor domain superfamily include NOG, CHRD, TWSG1, FST, FSTL1, SPARC, Agrin, Testican, Hevin, mac25, Ovomucoid, Complement C6. GREM1 and Complement C7 genes [PMID:9799587][PMID:11992721]. However, these superfamily members are difficult to align, so in this tree we have included just the CHRD and NOG genes. Note that Pfam lists some plant genes with kazal-type serine protease inhibitor domains, which are likely to be outgroups to the NOG, CHRD other kazal-type serine protease inhibitor superfamily genes. The separate TreeFam families containing proteins with kazal-type serine protease inhibitor superfamily genes should perhaps be merged in the future.

TF105072	COX11	COX11 homolog, cytochrome c oxidase assembly protein		19	44		0000-00-00	2005-04-12	curated	Cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the terminal component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, catalyzes the electron transfer from reduced cytochrome c to oxygen. This component is a heteromeric complex consisting of 3 catalytic subunits encoded by mitochondrial genes and multiple structural subunits encoded by nuclear genes. The mitochondrially-encoded subunits function in electron transfer, and the nuclear-encoded subunits may function in the regulation and assembly of the complex. This nuclear gene encodes a protein which is not a structural subunit, but may be a heme A biosynthetic enzyme involved in COX formation, according to the yeast mutant studies. However, the studies in Rhodobacter sphaeroides suggest that this gene is not required for heme A biosynthesis, but required for stable formation of the Cu(B) and magnesium centers of COX. This human protein is predicted to contain a transmembrane domain localized in the mitochondrial inner membrane. A pseudogene COX11P has been found on chromosome 6.

However, I have left Noggin and Chordin in separate TreeFam families, as they are distantly related. In fact, the DAND family, Noggin, and Chordin all belong to the cystine-knot superfamily of proteins with a cystine-knot structural motif. This superfamily is animal-specific, and comprises of many proteins such as BMP antagonists, TGF-beta, growth differentiation factors (GDFs), gonadotropins, platelet-derived growth factors, and BMPs [PMID:11328851].

This complex is involved in controlling proteolysis. The COPS5 subunit is the isopeptidase that deconjugates the essential ubiquitin-like Nedd8 modification from E3 ubiquitin-ligases" cullin subunits [PMID: 15571808].	The monkey gene 95JW5_MACFA seems to be truncated

Alignment indicates that the two BRARE sequences are fragments with slight overlap , therefore they are grouped. Bringing DROME inside nematodes decreases the likelihood of the tree, however this modification is supported by the alignment.

Preproteins are initially bound by TOMM20 and then passed to TOMM22, maintaining preproteins in an unfolded state and prevent them from aggregation [PMID: 14699115].	
TF106301	NARG1	NMDA receptor regulated 1		23	82		0000-00-00	2006-01-16	raw	This gene encodes a protein of unknown function. However, similarity to proteins in yeast and other species suggests that this protein may be an N-acetyltransferase.	I am not sure the Ciona gene is rightly placed. But the bootstrapping value is so high that I dare not change the topology.
