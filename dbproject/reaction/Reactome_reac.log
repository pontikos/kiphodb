In response to DNA damage due to ionizing radiation, the serine at position 15 of the p53 tumor suppressor protein is rapidly phosphorylated by the ATM kinase.  This serves to stabilize the p53 protein.  A rise in the levels of the p53 protein induce the expression of the p21 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor.  This prevents the normal progression from G1 to S phase, thus providing a check on replication of damaged DNA.

During G1, the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) is kept in check by the CDK inhibitors (CKIs) p27 and p21, thereby preventing premature entry into S phase (see Guardavaccaro and Pagano, 2006). The efficient recognition and ubiquitination of p27 by the SCF(Skp2) complex requires the formation of a trimeric complex containing p27 and cyclin E/A:Cdk2. [Guardavaccaro & Pagano 2006]

Substrate specificity of cyclin B:Cdk1 complexes is primarily conferred  by their subcellular localization (Draviam et al., 2001).Cyclin B1 is primarily cytoplasmic but  shuttles continuously between the nucleus and the cytoplasm during interphase (Hagting et al. 1998 Down; Toyoshima et al. 1998 Down; Yang et al. 1998 Down). At the end of prophase, it abruptly translocates into the nucleus (Furuno et al. 1999 Down; Hagting et al. 1999 Down) and then associates with mitotic apparatus (Pines and Hunter 1991 Down; Hagting et al. 1998 Down; Clute and Pines 1999 Down). Cyclin B2 is primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus during interphase and mitosis (Jackman et al. 1995 Down; Brandeis et al. 1998 Down). Cyclin B1–CDK1 promotes chromosome condensation, reorganization microtubule reorgnization, and   disassembly of the nuclear lamina and the Golgi apparatus. Cyclin B2–CDK1 functions in disassembly of the Golgi apparatus (Draviam et al., 2001). [Draviam et al 2001, Hagting et al 1998, Toyoshima et al 1998, Yang et al 1998, Hagting et al 1999, Pines & Hunter 1991, Clute & Pines 1999, Jackman et al 1995, Brandeis et al 1998]

The fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase activity of cytosolic phosphofructokinase 2/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase catalyzes the hydrolysis of fructose 2,6 bisphosphate to form fructose 6-phosphate. Fructose 2,6 bisphosphate is a key allosteric regulator of PFK1. In its absence the activity of PFK1 is reduced while fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase is activated, thus inhibiting glycolysis and favoring gluconeogenesis (Pilkis et al. 1995).

Phosphorylation of UBF-1, bound to the promoter, activates UBF-1 and recruits SL1, and eventually polymerase. This phosphorylation of UBF-1 by Erk1, has been shown to both weaken the binding of UBF-1 to DNA and to activate transcription (the authors of the paper showing these data suggest that loosening the binding of UBF-1 with the promoter may somehow promote transcription initiation). Though not definitively worked out phosphorylation of UBF-1 by Erk1 plays a role in the activation of the UBF-1:rDNA complex.

For the receptor to autophosphorylate requires a lysine at position 1030 to stabilize the gamma phosphate of ATP whilst the adenosine of ATP itself interacts with three glycines at residues 1003 - 1008. The first tyrosine residues to be autophosphorylated are 1158, 1162 and 1163 in the tyrosine kinase domain. This is shortly followed by tyrosine 972 in the juxtamembrane domain and tyrosines 1328 and 1330. These tyrosines fall into the three distinct tyrosine phosphorylation domains of the beta-subunit. In total there are 13 potential tyrosines that may be phosphorylated. The receptor phosphorylates itself in a trans rather than cis manner. That is one beta-subunit of the receptor phosphorylates the other rather than itself.

ATM mediated phosphorylation of BRCA1 at Ser 1189, Ser 1542 and Ser 1524 (Cortez et al., 1999)  is regulated by MDC1 (Lou et al., 2003). BRCA1 plays an important role in the response to double-strand breaks, participating in genome surveillance, DNA repair, and cell cycle checkpoint arrests. BRCA1 is required for ATM-dependent phosphorylation of NBS1 following exposure to ionizing radiation (Foray et al., 2003). BRCA1 also interacts with the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 complex which has been implicated early in HRR during resection of the double-strand break. [Cortez et al 1999, Foray et al 2003]

NSB1 is a component of the MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 complex which acts early in HRR during resection of the double-strand break. In addition, NBS1 is required for activation of the S-phase checkpoint in response to ionizing radiation (IR), ATM-dependent activation of CHK2 and cell survival after exposure to IR.

H2AX phosphorylation (producing the  gamma-H2AX protein form) occurs within 1-3 minutes of DNA damage  (Rogakou et al,1998) and is promoted by MDC1/NFBD1 (Stewart et al., 2003). gamma H2AX is one of the first proteins to appear at the site of damage, localizing  to a region of about 2 Mbp surrounding the site of the double-strand break (Rogakou et al,1998). gamma-H2AX appears to play an essential role in recruiting other repair proteins including Rad50, Rad51 and BRCA1(Paull et al., 2000) (Stewart et al., 2003).

Un as yet unidentified protein tyrosine kinase located in the plasma membrane phosphorylates Tyrosines 340 and 341 (Y1, Y2) of Raf-1. Tyrosine phosphorylation serves to further stabilise the active 'open' Raf-1 conformation. (While the kinase has not been definitively identified, the Src kinase is a plausible candidate.)

PI3Ks are implicated in cell growth, number and size. Dp110, the Drosophila PI3K, phosphorylates PIP2 -> PIP3 (both intracellular messengers) to continue the signaling mechanism. Overexpression of Dp110 results in enlarged cell size and number suggesting a role for Dp110 in growth and size control.

DPDK1 (a phosphoinositide-dependant protein kinase) controls cellular and organism growth through two effector pathways by activating DAkt and DS6K (S6 kinase). Phosphorylation of the residues Thr308 and Ser473 by DPDK1 (and another downstream kinase?) relieves intermolecular inhibition, allowing the activated DAkt to dissociate from PIP3 and modify its target, DFOXO.

DFOXO belongs to the FOXO subfamily of forkhead transcription factors. The FOXO factors regulate genes involved in cell cycle control, cell death and stress responses. Phosphorylation of DFOXO by DAkt1 on three residues (Thr44, Ser190 and Ser259) leads to its cytoplasmic retention and inactivation, inhibiting expression of DFOXO-regulated genes. These include D4EBP, DInR and Chico.

The cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB), a key regulator of gene expression, is activated by phosphorylation on Ser-133. Several different protein kinases possess the capability of driving this phosphorylation, making it a point of potential convergence for multiple intracellular signaling cascades. Work in neurons has indicated that physiologic synaptic stimulation recruits a fast calmodulin kinase IV (CaMKIV)-dependent pathway that dominates early signaling to CREB.

Cdk-9 is the kinase subunit of P-TEFb that phosphorylates Serine 2 on the heptapeptide repeats of Pol II CTD alleviating the negative action of DSIF-NELF complex.  This reaction is considered to be a rate limiting step for processive elongation. P-TEFb complex, that has a DRB-sensitive cyclin-dependent kinase activity, is composed of ~43 kDa, Cdk9 kinase (PITALRE), and either Cyclin T1, Cyclin T2a, Cyclin T2b, or Cyclin K. The exact mechanism by which P-TEFb removes the inhibition of elongation by DSIF-NELF is not yet known. P-TEFb is also capable of phosphorylating Spt5 subunit of DSIF complex.   A P-TEFb complex (which contains only the Cyclin T1)  is implicated in the efficient synthesis of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) transcripts. Cyclin T1 subunit of the P-TEFb(Cyclin T1:Cdk9) complex interacts with HIV-1 encoded Tat protein that binds to the transactivation response (TAR) element in the nascent HIV-1 transcript (reviewed in Price,2000). The mechanism by which DSIF, NELF and P-TEFb or TAK/P-TEFb act together in Pol II-regulated elongation is yet to be fully understood. Various biochemical evidences point to a model in which DSIF and NELF negatively regulate elongation through interactions with polymerase containing a hypophosphorylated CTD. Subsequent phosphorylation of the Pol II CTD by P-TEFb might promote elongation by inhibiting interactions of DSIF and NELF with the elongation complex. [Wada et al 1999, Price 2000]

At the beginning of this reaction, 1 molecule of 'GP VI:Fc Epsilon R1 gamma:Collagen IV complex', and 1 molecule of 'ATP' are present. At the end of this reaction, 1 molecule of 'ADP', and 1 molecule of 'GP VI:phosphorylated Fc Epsilon R1 gamma:Collagen IV complex' are present. This reaction is mediated by the 'protein-tyrosine kinase activity' of 'GP VI: Fc Epsilon R1 gamma: Collagen IV: SRC'.
