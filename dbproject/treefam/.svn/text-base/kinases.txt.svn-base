TF105114	MAP3K4	mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 4		7	46		0000-00-00	2005-04-21	curated	The central core of each mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is a conserved cascade of 3 protein kinases: an activated MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK) phosphorylates and activates a specific MAPK kinase (MAPKK), which then activates a specific MAPK. While the ERK MAPKs are activated by mitogenic stimulation, the CSBP2 and JNK MAPKs are activated by environmental stresses such as osmotic shock, UV irradiation, wound stress, and inflammatory factors. This gene encodes a MAPKKK, the MEKK4 protein, also called MTK1. This protein contains a protein kinase catalytic domain at the C terminus. The N-terminal nonkinase domain may contain a regulatory domain. Expression of MEKK4 in mammalian cells activated the CSBP2 and JNK MAPK pathways, but not the ERK pathway. In vitro kinase studies indicated that recombinant MEKK4 can specifically phosphorylate and activate PRKMK6 and SERK1, MAPKKs that activate CSBP2 and JNK, respectively but cannot phosphorylate PRKMK1, an MAPKK that activates ERKs. MEKK4 is a major mediator of environmental stresses that activate the CSBP2 MAPK pathway, and a minor mediator of the JNK pathway. Two alternatively spliced transcripts encoding distinct isoforms have been described.

Trk receptors are a family of three receptor tyrosine kinases, each of which can be activated by one or more of four neurotrophins (NTs). Neurotrophins bind to Trk receptor tyrosine kinases to activate several different signaling pathways that mediate various biological functions. Neurotrophin signaling through these receptors regulates cell survival, proliferation, the fate of neural precursors, axon and dendrite growth and patterning, and the expression and activity of functionally important proteins, such as ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors. In the adult nervous system, the Trk receptors regulate synaptic strength and plasticity. Trk receptor activation has been well-studied and triggers the well-characterized Ras/Rap-MAPK, PI3K-Akt, and PLCgamma-PKC cascades [PMID:12676795][PMID:16699811].	[alc] The TRK TreeFam family belongs to the Tyr protein kinase protein superfamily, which has members in plants and fungi. We could perhaps use a plant/fungal Tyr protein kinase gene as an outgroup to this TreeFam family; however, the diverse domain architectures found in this family may make it difficult to identify a good outgroup.

The mammalian testis-specific thioredoxin system comprises three thioredoxins exclusively expressed in spermatids, (including TXNDC3, which is in this family; also called SPTRX2), and an additional thioredoxin highly expressed in testis called TXNDC6 (also called TXL2) [PMID:14713334]. The TXNDC3 and TXNDC6 proteins in this family have an N-terminal thioredoxin domain and a C-terminal NDP kinase domain. In contrast, there are also NME7 proteins in this family, which have an NDP kinase domain, but no thioredoxin domain. Nucleoside diphosphate kinases are enzymes required for the synthesis of nucleoside triphosphates other than ATP [PMID:11768308].	[lh3] TXNDC3 is also called NME8. [alc] Merged the TreeFam families TF106374 and TF106372, as TF106372 didn"t have a plant/fungal outgroup. The genes in the two families all have a nucleoside diphosphate kinase domain, although many genes in family TF106374 had a nucleoside diphosphate kinase domain and a Dpy-30 domain, while many genes in the TF106372 family had a thioredoxin Pfam domain and a nucleoside diphosphate kinase Pfam domain. When the two families are merged, the new tree is based on the nucleoside diphosphate kinase domain, and the outgroup sequences form a clade with 100% bootstrap support.

MAP kinases, also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), act as an integration point for multiple biochemical signals, and are involved in a wide variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, transcription regulation and development. The activation of this kinase requires its phosphorylation by upstream kinases.

TF105117	MAP3K8	mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 8		7	29		0000-00-00	2005-04-21	curated	This gene was identified by its oncogenic transforming activity in cells. The encoded protein is a member of the serine/threonine protein kinase family. This kinase can activate both the MAP kinase and JNK kinase pathways. This kinase was shown to activate IkappaB kinases, and thus induce the nuclear production of NF-kappaB. This kinase was also found to promote the production of TNF-alpha and IL-2 during T lymphocyte activation. Studies of a similar gene in rat suggested the direct involvement of this kinase in the proteolysis of NF-kappaB1,p105 (NFKB1). This gene may also utilize a downstream in-frame translation start codon, and thus produce an isoform containing a shorter N-terminus. The shorter isoform has been shown to display weaker transforming activity.

TF105116	MAP3K7	mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 7		15	62		0000-00-00	2005-04-21	curated	The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the serine/threonine protein kinase family. This kinase mediates the signaling transduction induced by TGF beta and morphogenetic protein (BMP), and controls a variety of cell functions including transcription regulation and apoptosis. In response to IL-1, this protein forms a kinase complex including TRAF6, MAP3K7P1/TAB1 and MAP3K7P2/TAB2; this complex is required for the activation of nuclear factor kappa B. This kinase can also activate MAPK8/JNK, MAP2K4/MKK4, and thus plays a role in the cell response to environmental stresses. Four alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been reported.	Two human genes are removed for fear that they might be wrongly included in full sequences.

Aurora A kinases are involved in the centrosome cycle and mitotic spindle formation. Aurora B kinases are involved in DNA condensation, chromosome bi-orientation, kinetochore-microtubule attachment and cytokinesis. [PMID: 14625535]	Tree of aurora A and B kinase domains using maximum parsimony in [PMID: 14625535] The B/C split probably occured after the Xenopus branch as the DNA sequence for the 4 Xenopus Aurora B genes is as similar to AURKB as it is to AURKC.

TF105831	RIOK1	RIO kinase 1 (yeast)	AD034; FLJ30006; bA288G3.1; RIO kinase 1 isoform 1; AD034 protein; Serine/threonine-protein kinase RIO1;	29	108		0000-00-00	2005-08-12	curated	A novel type of protein kinase with low sequence similarity to conventional protein kinases [PMID: 12135737].	Root with ARATH decreases the likelihood of the tree, however the alignment supports modification therefore it is retained.

MAP kinases act as an integration point for multiple biochemical signals, and are involved in a wide variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, transcription regulation and development. This kinase is specifically activated by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 5 (MAP2K5/MEK5). It is involved in the downstream signaling processes of various receptor molecules including receptor type kinases, and G protein-coupled receptors. In response to extracelluar signals, this kinase translocates to cell nucleus, where it regulates gene expression by phosphorylating, and activating different transcription factors. Four alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene encoding two distinct isoforms have been reported.	Cut tree at yeast outgroup. Removed ENSDART00000048141 (not in Ensembl anymore)

TF105100	MAPK8-14	mitogen-activated protein kinase 8-14		73	294		0000-00-00	2006-02-21	raw		I delete EAA09792 and a TETNG gene. I think some of their exons are wrongly annotated, which interfere with tree building. I do not know how to place p38c_DROME and pmk-3_CAEEL, and so I do not do any modification around them.
