						<p>KiPhoDB is a database that contains biological information about kinases, phosphatases and their substrates. The mission of KiPhoDB is to keep this information as accurate and up to date as possible and provide it to the scientific community in the hope that it will be useful. <br/> <br/> The main feature of KiPhoDB is that it enables scientists to discover kinase/phosphatase pairs that act on the same substrate. Moreover, KiPhoDB can display a wide variety of information concerning kinases and phosphatases, such as the reactions and the signaling pathways that these molecules are involved into. Finally, for each protein KiPhoDB contains information about its phosphorylation sites, its Gene Ontology annotation, its domains and many external links to other websites and biological databases.

						<h1><i>In More Detail...</i></h1><br/>
						The need for a comprehensive database for kinases, phosphatases and the pathways that these molecules are involved in has been a concern for many molecular biologists and scientists. Although some databases for kinases, phosphatases and phosphorylation sites already exist, to the best of our knowledge there is no database that links these two categories of enzymes and lists the reactions that they participate in. This is the main aim of KiPhoDB. In the following we will provide you with some background information about phosphorylation, kinases and phosphatases.<br/><br/>
						<table border="0"><tr><td><h2>Phosphorylation</h2><p>Phosphorylation is a chemical reaction in which a phosphate group (PO<sub>4</sub>) is added to a biological molecule. This molecule can be a protein, a lipid or any other kind of organic molecule. Protein phosphorylation is one of the most common post translational modifications of proteins and it plays a significant role in a wide variety of cellular processes in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, including cellular growth, differentiation and DNA repair. In eukaryotic cells phosphorylation occurs mainly on Serine, Threonine and Tyrosine amino acids, whereas in prokaryotic cells it occurs mainly on Histidine, Arginine and Lysine residues.</p></td><td><img src="images/phosphate.png"></td></tr></table><br/><br/>
						<table border="0"><tr><td><img src="images/kinase.png"></td><td><h2 align="right">Kinases</h2><p align="right">Kinase is a type of enzyme that transfers phosphate groups from high energy donor molecules, such as ATP, to specific target molecules, namely substrates. They are also known as phosphotransferases and they can act on more than one phosphorylation sites on the surface of a given substrate. At the time of writing, up to 518 distinct kinases have been identified in humans. Apart from proteins, kinases can also act in other small molecules, such as lipids, nucleotides, carbohydrates and others. They are enormously diverse and they play a central role in signaling. These two facts make kinases attractive targets for drug design. Most protein kinases belong to a single superfamily containing a eukaryotic protein kainse (ePK) catalytic domain, but there are further classifications.</p></td></tr></table><br/><br/>
						<table border="0"><tr><td><h2>Phosphatases</h2><p>The main function of a phosphatase is to dephosphorylate a substrate protein,	which in some cases can be a kinase, by removing the phosphate group (PO<sub>4</sub>). Like kinases, these enzymes play a major role in signal transduction. Phosphatases are thought to be less specific than kinases as they act on a wider range of substrates. Also there are much less phosphatases than there are kinases.</p></td><td><img src="images/phosphatase.png"></td></tr></table><br/>
