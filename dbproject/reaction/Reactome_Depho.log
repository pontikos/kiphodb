Glucose-6-phosphatase associated with the inner face of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate to glucose and orthophosphate (reviewed by Van Scaftingen and Gerin 2002). This reaction is essentially irreversible. Defects in glucose-6-phosphatase are the cause of glycogen storage disease type 1a (Lei et al. 1995). [Van Schaftingen & Gerin 2002]

With insulin dissociated from its receptor the signal to sustain the receptor kinase's activity is also removed. Thus endosomally-associated protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are able to dephosphorylate the receptor which now can not rephosphorylate themselves since insulin is removed and the receptor is in the inactive protein conformation. (The identity of these PTPs is not clearly established yet. A discussion of candidates will be added in the near future.)The dephosphorylation of the receptor is also a signal for the receptor to recycle back to the plasma membrane.

After the capping complex is formed, the RNA triphosphatase activity of the capping enzyme hydrolyzes the 5'-end phosphate group of the nascent mRNA transcript to a diphosphate.The RNA triphosphatase (RTP) domain of mammalian capping enzyme is a member of a superfamily of phosphatases that include the protein tyrosine phosphatases, some lipid phosphatases, and several nucleic acid phosphatases. This family uses a conserved nucleophilic cysteine residue to attack the target phosphate. A transient phospho-cysteinyl enzyme intermediate is then hydrolyzed to regenerate the enzyme active site. It should be noted that while higher eukaryotic capping enzymes use PTP-like triphosphatase domains, the yeast triphosphatases are a completely different class of enzymes. The yeast RTPs are metal-dependent phosphatases. RNA 5'-triphosphatase (RTP) catalyzed first reaction can be represented as:pppN(pN)n + GTP -> ppN(pN)n + Pi; (n=20-25)

FCP1 dephosphorylates RNAP II in ternary elongation complexes as well as in solution and, therefore, is thought to function in the recycling of RNAP II during the transcription cycle. Biochemical experiments suggest that human FCP1 targets CTDs that are phosphorylated at serine 2 (CTD-serine 2) and/or CTD-serine 5. It is also observed to stimulate elongation independent of its catalytic activity. Dephosphorylation of Ser2 - phosphorylated Pol II results in hypophosphorylated form that disengages capping enzymes (CE). [Mandal et al 2002]
