Xanthosine 5"-triphosphate (XTP) is also a potential substrate. The function of this ubiquitous protein family is proposed to be the elimination of minor potentially mutagenic or clastogenic purine nucleoside triphosphates from the cell. [PMID: 11278832]

TF105123	DUSP12	dual specificity phosphatase 12		14	48		0000-00-00	2005-04-23	curated	The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the dual specificity protein phosphatase subfamily. These phosphatases inactivate their target kinases by dephosphorylating both the phosphoserine/threonine and phosphotyrosine residues. They negatively regulate members of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase superfamily (MAPK/ERK, SAPK/JNK, p38), which is associated with cellular proliferation and differentiation. Different members of the family of dual specificity phosphatases show distinct substrate specificities for various MAP kinases, different tissue distribution and subcellular localization, and different modes of inducibility of their expression by extracellular stimuli. This gene product is the human ortholog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae YVH1 protein tyrosine phosphatase. It is localized predominantly in the nucleus, and is novel in that it contains, and is regulated by a zinc finger domain.	I can see the ARATH outgroup, but I delete them to ensure a correct full tree.

The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the dual specificity protein phosphatase subfamily. These phosphatases inactivate their target kinases by dephosphorylating both the phosphoserine/threonine and phosphotyrosine residues. They negatively regulate members of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase superfamily (MAPK/ERK, SAPK/JNK, p38), which is associated with cellular proliferation and differentiation. Different members of the family of dual specificity phosphatases show distinct substrate specificities for various MAP kinases, different tissue distribution and subcellular localization, and different modes of inducibility of their expression by extracellular stimuli. This gene product is localized to the nucleus, and is novel in that it binds directly to RNA and splicing factors, and thus suggested to participate in nuclear mRNA metabolism.	Few members, but diffcult to curate.

Regulatory subunits (R1 and R2) have been identified in mammals that interact with the catalytic subunit of PPP4 (PPP4C, encoded by this TreeFam family) and control its activity. PPP4C-R2 complexes play roles in the assembly of organelles, including the centrosome and spliceosome [PMID:15913612].	Cohen et al 2005 [PMID:15913612] state that Saccharomyces cerevisiae PPH3 is the yeast orthologue of this family, which agrees with our results.

The alignment indicates that they are separate branches but it is not clear which is closer to vertebrates, therefore the species tree is followed.
